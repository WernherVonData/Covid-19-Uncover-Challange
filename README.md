## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

In the time of the Coronavirus outbreak, I decided to train and utilize my data scientist skills to analyze the COVID-19 data to answer some crucial questions asked by the people.

This repository is not longer updated, please refer to the https://www.kaggle.com/danpeczek/be-safe-who-is-in-the-biggest-need-of-ppe if you want to see the latest version - keeping it updated in two places would be very troublesome when it comes to the dataset updates, so I've made decision to keep it on Kaggle, where I can have the biggest flexibility regarding keeping it up to date.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

This repository contains one jupyter notebook file where analysis about needs for protective equipment for COVID-19 is required.
